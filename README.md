# Aim-Trainer
A game where players can improve their muscle memory by clicking circles. HELLO! This is an Aim Trainer I made for our first project in GA. The purpose of this game is to improve your muscle memory and aim in fps video games. To play the game, simply click the circles as fast as you can, trying to get the most circles in the least amount of time. I really enjoyed creating this not only because it pushed me to learn new things in JS, but because I can actually use my own game when trying to improve in fps's. How the game works: 
1.) a user will have two options. Practice or Start.

2.) on Start click, the user will see a circle appear. The user will click the circle which will trigger a function to create a new randomly generated circle.

3.) The process will continue until the user misses a circle. When the user clicks outside of the circle they will see an alert which will tell them the amount of circles they clicked as well as the time it took them to click them.

4.) The alert will refresh the page after clicking ok, restarting the game.

5.) On practice click, the user will see much larger circles appear with no time, score, and circles will be in a fixed position each time. This is implemented so the user can get a feel for how the game works and not be under the pressure of a timer. Also, the user will not be notified if they miss a circle allowing a more casual experience. Both modes are great for improving. The practice mode is more focused around muscle memory. The start mode is closer to an in game experience, where muscle memory, reaction time, and aim play a big role.
